System info
===========

This is a minimal kernel configuration for Firecracker VMs. Compile the
amd64 kernel with

  make -C linux-amd64
  cp linux-amd64/arch/x86/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin boot/linux-amd64

as we need an ELF executable boot/linux rather than a compressed image.

The build process for arm64 is more standard: compile the kernel with

  make -C linux-arm64
  cp linux-arm64/arch/arm64/boot/Image boot/linux-arm64

or cross-compile it with

  make -C linux-arm64 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-musl-
  cp linux-arm64/arch/arm64/boot/Image boot/linux-arm64

An example configuration is in guest.json: run with

  firecracker --no-api --config-file guest.json

to use the kernel 'linux' and rootfs 'rootfs' in the working directory.
