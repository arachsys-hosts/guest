System info
===========

This is a minimal kernel configuration for Firecracker VMs. Build with

  make -C linux vmlinux
  objcopy -R .comment -S linux/vmlinux boot/linux
  chmod a-x boot/linux

as we need an ELF executable boot/linux rather than a compressed image.

An example configuration is in guest.json; run with

  firecracker --no-api --config-file guest.json

to use the kernel 'linux' and rootfs 'rootfs' in the working directory.
