System info
===========

This is a minimal kernel configuration for Firecracker VMs. Build with

  make vmlinux
  strip vmlinux

as we need an ELF executable rather than a bootable compressed image.

An example configuration is in guest.json; run with

  firecracker --no-api --config-file guest.json

to use the kernel from /guest/linux and rootfs from /guest/rootfs.
